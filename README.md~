## Geometric Supply-Demmand Relation Model is a novel paradigm to vizualize the Supply and Demmand for shares of a single company, and studiying its geometric relations

The prices of most products are derived from the relation of supply and demand - how much it is available of item A, and how much buyers want of it. The products of the stock market - bonds, assets, stocks - are no different.

Various common methods to identify and predict trends of price fluctuations are based on indexes and indicators obtained from important institutions, and analysis based on calculating Moving Averages (MAs), average of the latest few operations involving certain stock. MA methods are efficient to visualize trends on a time series, however, being based on the last several operations, may be slow to respond to change on values observed in fewer operations than the amount considered by the methods.

We developed GeoSDR (Geometric Supply-Demand Relation) Model, a novel mathematical-Geometric model that illustrates the momentary relation between the Supply and Demand for stocks of a single company, and produces data that can be used to model the behavior of the prices of said stock interactively.

In this repository, we modeled real data of the Brazilian BMFBovespa stock exchange with GeoSDR, and provide an interactive tool for GeoSRD vizualizations of stock market data.
